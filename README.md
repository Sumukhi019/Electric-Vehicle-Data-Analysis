# Electric Vehicles Analysis 

## Overview
This repository contains visualizations and analysis of electric vehicles using Tableau. The project aims to assess the market landscape, technological advancements, and market share of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs).

## Objectives
The primary objectives of this analysis are to:
1. Assess the overall size and growth of the EV market by calculating the total number of vehicles.
2. Determine the average electric range of the vehicles to evaluate technological progress and efficiency.
3. Identify and analyze the total number of BEVs, including their percentage relative to the total EV market.
4. Identify and analyze the total number of PHEVs, including their percentage relative to the total EV market.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis includes information on various electric vehicles, specifically focusing on their type (BEV or PHEV) and their electric range. The dataset is structured as an Excel file, with columns representing relevant attributes such as vehicle type, eligibility for Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV), and electric range.

## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the electric vehicle market, focusing on key metrics to understand the size, growth, and technological advancements of the market. By examining both BEVs and PHEVs, we gain insights into the distribution and market share of different types of electric vehicles.
